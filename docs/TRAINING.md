# Native LoRA Training

`sa3-train` trains a DiT LoRA/DoRA adapter directly in C++/ggml from MP3/caption pairs and writes an adapter GGUF that loads through the existing `sa3-generate --lora` path.

## Build

```sh
./build.sh cpu
./build.sh cuda
```

CUDA is the target backend for real training runs. CPU builds are useful for parser, dataset, and checkpoint tests. See [NON_GPU_TESTS.md](NON_GPU_TESTS.md) for the registered CTest suite.

## Models

Download the normal inference GGUF set and its matching training base:

```sh
python tools/download_models.py --variant medium --encoding f16 --training-base
```

Training additionally needs the matching base DiT. Adapters are trained on `medium-base`,
`small-music-base`, or `small-sfx-base`, then applied to `medium`, `small-music`, or `small-sfx`
respectively at inference. `sa3-train --model <variant>` resolves the normal tokenizer, T5/Gemma
encoder, conditioner, and SAME files, but requires a separate
`stable-audio-3-<variant>-base-dit-*-F16.gguf`; it will not silently train on the ARC/post-trained
inference DiT. See [the models README](../models/README.md#lora-training-bases) for conversion details.
Adapter checkpoint metadata and tensor shapes are documented in
[lora_checkpoint_contract.md](lora_checkpoint_contract.md).

F16 is the recommended training encoding. The frozen base DiT weights remain F16 while adapter
parameters and optimizer state remain F32, matching the reference trainer's memory-saving
`--base_precision fp16` configuration.

## Dataset

The expected dataset layout is:

```text
datasets/mnesia-audio-v1/
  train/filelist.txt
  train/metadata.jsonl
  train/audio/*.mp3
  train/audio/*.txt
  test/...
  evaluation/...
```

Training honors `train/filelist.txt`. Test and evaluation splits are loaded only for validation/evaluation and are rejected if any train item overlaps by basename, canonical path, or `audio_sha256`.

## Train

```sh
build-cuda/bin/sa3-train \
  --model medium \
  --models-dir models \
  --dataset ../datasets/mnesia-audio-v1 \
  --adapter-type lora \
  --rank 8 \
  --alpha 8 \
  --learning-rate 0.0001 \
  --frames 128 \
  --batch-size 1 \
  --checkpoint-every 1 \
  --prompt-mode caption \
  --out train-runs/mnesia-lora
```

The current graph executes one physical sample at a time. Use `--batch-size 1`.

The native target inventory contains the DiT's Linear/Conv weights: 228 targets for medium and 152
for small. It intentionally does not adapt the separate `seconds_total` conditioner Linear (the
optional 229th medium or 153rd small reference target).
Stable Audio 3's training guide recommends `--exclude seconds_total` for small datasets to avoid
conditioner hijacking; use that exclusion for direct cross-framework comparisons.

Small-model training uses the same command with `--model small-music` or `--model small-sfx` and
requires its matching `*-base` DiT. Small-music and small-sfx share the same standard-attention
architecture and local/inpainting conditioning shape; a small-music smoke therefore exercises the
same native graph structure used by small-sfx.

`--adapter-type` accepts `lora`, `dora-rows`, `dora-cols`, `bora`, and their `-xs`
variants (`lora-xs`, `dora-rows-xs`, `dora-cols-xs`, `bora-xs`). The `-xs` families
freeze `U`/`V` as the top-`rank` SVD bases of each base weight and train only the small
`M_xs` core (plus DoRA/BoRA magnitudes). Those bases are computed natively by default;
pass `--svd-bases bases.gguf` to load precomputed bases instead — generate them with
`python tools/compute_svd_bases.py --dit models/... --rank 8 --out bases.gguf` for exact
`torch.linalg.svd` parity with the reference implementation.

`--prompt-mode caption` trains on the split caption text only. For lyric-aware
experiments, use `--prompt-mode caption-lyrics`; if a sample has
`lyrics_path` metadata, the trainer appends `Lyrics:` plus that lyric text to
the caption before encoding the conditioning prompt. `--prompt-mode lyrics`
uses lyric text alone when present and falls back to the caption otherwise.

## Outputs

The output directory contains:

- `adapter-step-*.gguf`
- `adapter-final.gguf`
- `metrics.jsonl`
- `config.snapshot.txt`
- `command.txt`

## Generate With The Adapter

```sh
build-cuda/bin/sa3-generate \
  --model medium \
  --models-dir models \
  --lora train-runs/mnesia-lora/adapter-final.gguf \
  --prompt "$(cat ../datasets/mnesia-audio-v1/evaluation/audio/single-moment.txt)" \
  --frames 128 \
  --steps 8 \
  --seed 42 \
  --out train-runs/mnesia-lora/eval-single-moment.wav
```

## Troubleshooting

- Missing model files: run `python tools/download_models.py --variant medium --training-base`.
- Missing captions or audio: inspect the split `filelist.txt` and `metadata.jsonl`; training fails before model loading.
- Split contamination: remove the duplicate item from train or held-out splits.
- FFmpeg decode failure: confirm `ffmpeg` is installed and can decode the MP3.
- CUDA build failure: verify the CUDA Toolkit is installed and rerun `./build.sh cuda`.
